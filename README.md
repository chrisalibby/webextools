# Webex Tools

A collection of scripts and tools that I've created to make life with the Webex platform easier.

## Personal Use Tools
* [WebexPoster](WebexPoster/README.md) - Uses your OAuth token to send messages as you from the command prompt.  Can use various placeholders to allow a dynamic message sent using a single command or cron job.

## Enterprise Tools
* [WebexCDR](WebexCDR/README.md) - Platform-independent Python solution for downloading Webex Call Detail Records and storing them in SQL Server. Features automatic OAuth token refresh, incremental sync, and scheduled task support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
